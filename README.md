# What is this?
This repository is a 'batteries-included' template for projects using 8bit PIC microcontrollers from Microchip. The primary development of this setup has been using the PIC18FxxK42 family, but many of the features should be applicable to other 8 bit PICs(PIC10, PIC12, PIC16).

# Getting Started
Make sure the [requirements](#-Requirements) are satisfied, then run the following commands:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/DaelonSuzuka/K42-Project-Template
cd K42-Project-Template
make compile
```
You can also star this project, then [create a new repository](https://github.com/new) and select `K-42-Project-Template` from the `Repository template` drop-down box. Unfortunately, GitHub templates do not preserve git submodules, so after you create your repo from the template, you'll need to manually add the submodules:

```
git clone <your repository URL>
cd <your new repo directory>
git submodule add https://github.com/DaelonSuzuka/K42-Peripheral-Libraries.git src/peripherals
git submodule add https://github.com/DaelonSuzuka/K42-System-Libraries.git src/os
git submodule add https://github.com/DaelonSuzuka/Easy-XC8.git toolchain
```
You should then commit your changes and push them back to GitHub.

# Requirements
- GNU Make (Tested with 3.8.2 and 4.4. Others probably work, but haven't been tested)
- python3 >= 3.6 (including the `venv` and `pip` modules)
- xc8 compiler (`xc8` must be on your path)
- mplabx IPE (`ipecmd` or `ipecmd.sh` must be on your path)

# Features

## [Easy XC8](https://github.com/DaelonSuzuka/Easy-XC8)
Easy XC8 is a no-hassle toolchain that frees you from the shackles of MPLABX IDE. 

Features:
- editor agnostic (I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- build your project
- upload your hex file using an attached USB programmer
- in-line code generation using [Ned Batchelder's Cog](https://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog/index.html) and my [CogUtils](https://github.com/DaelonSuzuka/CogUtils) and [CodeGen](https://github.com/DaelonSuzuka/CodeGen) libraries
- creating documentation with [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html)
- static analysis using [Cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/), and possibly clang-analyzer in the future

## [K42 Peripheral Libraries](https://github.com/DaelonSuzuka/K42-Peripheral-Libraries)
This repository has drivers for the following peripherals:
- Analog-to-Digital Converter
- Configurable Logic Cells
- Device Information Area
- Fixed Voltage Reference/Temperature Indicator Module
- High/Low Voltage Detect
- Interrupt
- Nonvolatile Memory
- Oscillator
- Ports
- Peripheral Pin Select
- Reset Handler
- Timers
- UARTs

## [K42 System Libraries](https://github.com/DaelonSuzuka/K42-System-Libraries)
The following system libraries are included:
- Serial Port, a UART wrapper that provides `getch()`, `putch()`, `print()`, and `println()`. defining `putch()` enables XC8's `printf()`
- Stopwatch, provides calibrated millisecond and microsecond stopwatches, and helper macros to help with profiling your code
- System Clock, a calibrated, 1ms resolution central clock, `delay_us()`, `delay_ms()`, `get_current_time()`, and `time_since()` 

## Included files
Additionally, a selection of example files are included. 

- `Makefile`, generated with the toolchain's install script
- `project.yaml`, generated with the toolchain's config wizard(`make config`)
- `cogfiles.txt`, the list of files to be processed by `make cog`
- `pins.csv`, this file defines all the pin settings, see [Pin Configuration](#-Pin-Configuration)
- `src/main.c`, 
- `src/config.h`, a reasonable collection of configuration bit settings
- `src/pins.c`, see [Pin Configuration](#-Pin-Configuration)
- `src/pins.h`, see [Pin Configuration](#-Pin-Configuration)
- `src/system.c`, 
- `src/system.h`, 

# Startup
TODO: Walk through `startup()` and the proper sequencing of `xxxx_init()`s.

# Pin Configuration
Pin configuration code in `src/pins.c` and `src/pins.h` is generated by embedded blocks of python code, powered by [Ned Batchelder's Cog](https://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog/). The actual code generation is handled [here](https://github.com/DaelonSuzuka/CodeGen/blob/master/codegen/pins.py).

Pin configurations are defined in `pins.csv`. The example code has two pins defined:

```
B0, DEBUG_TX_PIN, output pps
B1, DEBUG_RX_PIN, input pps
```

This causes the following code to be generated in `pins.c`:
```c
// GPIO read functions
// none

// GPIO write functions
// none

void pins_init(void) {
  // DEBUG_TX_PIN
  TRISBbits.TRISB0 = 0;

  // DEBUG_RX_PIN
  TRISBbits.TRISB1 = 1;
}
```
And the following code to be generated in `pins.h`:
```c
// GPIO read functions
// none

// GPIO write functions
// none

// PPS initialization macros
#define PPS_DEBUG_TX_PIN PPS_OUTPUT(B, 0)
#define PPS_DEBUG_RX_PIN PPS_INPUT(B, 1)

// ADC Channel Select macros
// none
```

These PPS initialization macros are then used in `system.c` to configure a UART for the serial port:
```c
uart_config_t config = UART_get_config(2);
config.baud = _115200;
config.txPin = PPS_DEBUG_TX_PIN;
config.rxPin = PPS_DEBUG_RX_PIN;
serial_port_init(UART_init(config));
```
